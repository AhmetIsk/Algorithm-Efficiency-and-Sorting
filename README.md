# Algorithm-Efficiency-and-Sorting
Implemented the insertion sort, quick sort, and merge sort algorithms for performance analysis and performed on three different kind of arrays: randomly created array, sorted array and already sorted array with different size conditions. Then, the gained data is interpreted and compared at the report.
